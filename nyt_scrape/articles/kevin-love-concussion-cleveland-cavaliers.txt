CLEVELAND — The Cavaliers’ All-Star forward Kevin Love will miss Game 7 of the N.B.A.’s Eastern Conference finals against the Celtics on Sunday night in Boston with a concussion.The team said on Saturday that Love, who bashed heads with the Boston rookie Jayson Tatum in the first half of Cleveland’s Game 6 win on Friday night, experienced concussion-like symptoms before the team’s flight and has been placed in the N.B.A.’s concussion protocol.Just minutes before the team announced Love’s status, Coach Tyronn Lue said he was still being evaluated.Love was kept out of the second half of Cleveland’s 109-99 victory as a precaution after he and Tatum accidentally knocked heads. Love has had at least two other known concussions in his career.The Cavaliers were able to overcome the loss of Love, their second-leading scorer and top rebounder, as LeBron James scored 46 and Cleveland got solid contributions from George Hill, Jeff Green and others to move one game closer to the N.B.A. finals
