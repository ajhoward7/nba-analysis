OAKLAND, Calif. — This week’s annual N.B.A. predraft camp in Chicago led to an unexpected spell of détente in the contentious Western Conference finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets.The Golden State owner Joe Lacob invited Houston’s general manager, Daryl Morey, to join a Warriors contingent that flew from Houston to Chicago on a private plane arranged by the Warriors, according to two people with knowledge of the flight.The shared commute took place this week after the Rockets evened the series, 1-1, with a home victory on Wednesday night in Game 2, according to the people, who were not authorized to discuss the details publicly.The best-of-seven series, which will decide a spot in the N.B.A. finals, is widely regarded as a showdown between the league’s two best teams before the actual championship round.The Rockets posted a league-high 65 wins during the regular season after Morey announced during an ESPN Radio interview in December that Houston “is basically obsessed with, ‘How do we beat the Warriors?’ ”“It’s the only thing we think about,” Morey said in that interview.The Warriors, of course, have won the N.B.A. title twice in the last three seasons and posted a record 73 wins in the regular season of 2016-17, when they fell a win short of a championship.The conference series resumes Sunday with Game 3 at Oracle Arena in Oakland, Calif.
